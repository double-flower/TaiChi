 # TaiChi: A Hybrid Compression Format for Binary Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication on GPU


 ## Usage
 1. prepare environment:
    please modify following variables in Makefile according specific environment
    > ARCH, CUDA_INSTALL_PATH, OPENCV_INCLUDES, CUSP_PATH
    
    CUSP library can be downloaded from http://cusplibrary.github.io/
 2. compile: 
    > make
    
 3. run: 
   
    > ./spmv matrixPath
   
## Dataset
The first group of matrices can be download from [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu/)

The second group of matrices, including of 12 R-MAT matrices, is generated by [GTgraph](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/software/GTgraph/), with parameters a, b, and c setting 0.499, 0.001, 0.001. These matrices can be download from [R-MAT-dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ratGG1-rE0qgVdpEFKuqbQ?pwd=1x24).
